<p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
<p>The UIAutomation module simplifies software testing automation when you are working on GUI tests. Based on the UI Automation library that is a part of .Net Framework since 3.0, the module is intended to make life of software engineers as easy as it may be.</p>
<p>For now, the module supports Win32, Windows Forms, WPF, Metro UI (WinRT), Java SWT*, PowerBuilder*, Delphi* applications and the number is counting. Third-party controls are supported if they are achievable via standard MS UI Automation, Win32 API or sending
 key codes and mouse clicks. (*To the extent they are supported by Microsoft UI Automation, Oracle Accessibility Bridge and Win32 API.)</p>

 as officially released versions. After enough-for-release changes being done, the last published or unpublished beta is being rebuilt and retested to release. As a rule, new features are used in real-life test suites for a time before publishing.</span></p>
