<div class="wikidoc">This is a runner for PowerShell commands that works similarly to powerslim, excluding the need in FitNesse.<br />The idea behind was to run relatively &#39;expensive&#39; (resource-consuming) modules only once per test suite.<br />
<h2>Where to use it</h2>It is for low-performing virtual machines. For example, it may take up to ten seconds for a virtual machine in a high-load evironment to load the UIAutomation module.<br />
<h2>How it works</h2>OnDemand runner is a script that monitors a file. When there is need to run a command, a test suite writes out a string a strings in a new file and copies the file in the place where the runner is waiting for an input.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
