Must be something simple I am overlooking. \r<br />\n<br />\nI cannot seem to get the text content from a SysTreeView32 Tree or TreeItem into a variable. How can I get the text? I see that the text in the TreeItem is in the Name property. But I cannot seem to get it.\r<br />\n<br />\nUsing UIAUtomationSpy, I see one of many TreeItems as follows:<br />\n<pre><code>Get-UiaWindow -Class '#32770' -Name 'myapp*' | `\nGet-UiaTree -AutomationId '1475' -Class 'SysTreeView32' -Name 'Tree1' | `\nGet-UiaTreeItem -Name 'my text here'\n</code></pre>\n\nI've tried every method and property and cmdlet I could find, but no luck. What can I use to get that 'my text here' into a variable? Or, what am I overlooking?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your help,\r<br />\nJoe<br />\n",
