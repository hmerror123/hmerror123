    "Html": "Hi Henkes,\r<br />\nhave you observed this window (the Default action set window) via UIAutomationSpy or, better, more spectacularly showing <a href=\"https://uiautomationverify.codeplex.com/releases/view/11366\" rel=\"nofollow\">UIA Verify</a>?\r<br />\nHow many controls are situated below this window? On what level (top-level or under your main window) is this window?\r<br />\n<br />\nUsually, 'freezing' of UIAutomation is just a walk thorough a wrong subtree. Consider the following situation:\r<br />\n-------------------------------your root----------------------\r<br />\n|. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|\r<br />\nsome controls. . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .your child window\r<br />\n|\r<br />\nmany controls\r<br />\n|\r<br />\nmuch more controls\r<br />\n<br />\nUIAutomation walks through another subtree of controls before visiting the subtree of your interest. This is because the logic is to enumerate top-level items with their subitems from the search root (the Automation Machine window in your case). The first or the second subtree is full of controls and UIAutomation works until it ensures that there is no such element (the .Default action set window).\r<br />\nGood or bad, there is no proof that the algorithm is wrong - if enumerate top-level, the 2nd-level controls and so on, there must be a situation when whis logic will freeze.\r<br />\n<br />\nProbably, there's another problem. What will be in the output if you run the following:<br />\n<pre><code>$FilterDialog | Get-UiaControl | Read-UiaControlName # or Read-UiaControlAutomationId</code></pre>\n\n? Does it return anything or freezes immediately?<br />\n",
