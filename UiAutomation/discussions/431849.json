However, I'll try:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>version 0.8.5 that was released today brings more improvements to search for controls (easier to write code)</li>\n<li>to spy a store app, you could use UIAutomationSpy from the ***.for.Metro.testing package\r<br />\nFollow the [url:instruction|<a href=\"http://uiautomation.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Installation%20for%20Metro%20UI%20testing&amp;referringTitle=Documentation]\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://uiautomation.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Installation%20for%20Metro%20UI%20testing&referringTitle=Documentation]</a> to install the module</li>\n<li>the spy itself is more or less understandable app, it reports a control it is hovering over in code you can use in your script</li>\n<li>there is also a tool from Microsoft, Inspect.exe, that could be used to spy Metro apps</li>\n<li>\nabout languages to develop the app: there is no restriction. I think that many default and 3rd party apps are written in C++ or C#. They are easily spied and the ability to be automated is sooner a matter of developer's wish to make an accessible app, rather than a technology/language.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI'll put a couple of examples soon.<br />\n",
